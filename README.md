## Contributing

This repository is maintained by 6 Hz IT Solutions Kft, and provided to the community free-of-charge. We do not plan to
extend the functionality of this library beyond the capabilities of the szamlazz.hu API. As a result, we do not expect 
contributions from the open-source community. We recommend to contact us before working on any changes you wish to
merge to upstream.

If you've found an issue, please open a GitHub issue or e-mail us at hello@6hz.hu.
